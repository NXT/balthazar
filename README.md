# Balthazar

Open-hardware laptop computer modules description and concept.

These are electronic schematic modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar
with the main aim for team access

We are building it from periphery - inwards.

KiCad 5.1.5 files you will find in:

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter and stereo power amplifier. 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified a bit ergonomic computer keyboard with "diy" approch. 
   in the two versions. The second iteration of the updated keyboard is having some more geometric consistency.

3. Module BalthazarIO is a simple USB2.0 four-port hub for the internal devices: 
   keyboard and touchpad (optional trackpad), webcam and optional audiocard.

Drawings, in DXF and DWG and STL formates in:

1. Case and the design

So, far no prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked in practise, however the progress and pictures of the first pre-prototype are to be seen on our https://balthazar.space website under the News and Specifications and all over (also, many pretty pictures there and user-case scenarios).

Some philosophy is in the .pdf files included. The newest is .pdf number 3.
