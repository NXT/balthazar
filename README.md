open-hardware laptop computer modules

These are electronic schematic modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar
with the main aim as team access

We are building it from periphery - inwards.

KiCad 5.1.5 files

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter and stereo power amplifier 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified a bit ergonomic computer keyboard

So-far no prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked in practise.
